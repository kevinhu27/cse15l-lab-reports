# Week 10 Lab

## Method of Finding Test Files
> The script.sh file was edited to print out each file that was being filed before returning the output.
> Then, two results.txt files were created in the two separate directories of the markdown parsers that were being compared.
> Lastly, the vimdiff command was used to open the two results.txt files to compare the differences in output.

### Test Files
[Test File 17](https://github.com/nidhidhamnani/markdown-parser/blob/main/test-files/17.md)

## Test File 1 (17.md)
* The shared implementation of markdown-parser produced the expected result.
